	"Description"	"Custom entrances and exits for your test chamber. **DO NOT delete the exit or entrance, while using the custom entrances/exits as this will break them! Just hide the normal exit/entrance!** Start reversed - when checked changes the item from entrance to exit. Start enabled switches the exit to be locked or unlocked. Inputs connected to entrances don't do anything! **Exits won't reset the map in PeTI editor, but they will work properly in workshop!**"
