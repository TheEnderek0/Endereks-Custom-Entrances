	"Description"	"Custom entrances and exits for your test chamber. **DO NOT delete the exit or entrance, while using the teleporters as this will break them! Just hide the exit!** Start reversed - when checked changes the teleporter from entrance to exit. Start enabled switches the exit teleporter to be locked or unlocked. Inputs connected to entrance teleporters don't do anything! **Exit teleporters won't reset the map in PeTI editor, but they will work properly in workshop!**"
